# A* - Project 3 phase 2, ENPM661
 
The project was created towards completion of Project 2 as part of ENPM661- Planning for Autonomous Robots at University of Maryland, College park

The obstacles were defined as shown in the problem statement. 

The Project contains 2 files
* Astar_rigid.py

## Dependencies to run the code. 


* Python Version 3
* Ubuntu 16.04 (might work on future version, not tested)
* OpenCV Version > 3.4.4

### Run the code. 

```
* Clone the repository
```
 run
```
* python3 Astar_rigid.py # for rigid robot
```
The user will be expected to enter the following:
Robot Radius
Clearance to obstacles
Starting point and coordinates
Goal Point
Robot step size
Angle between vectors of travel
Distance from goal that will denote a success 


A video will be generated upon completion
